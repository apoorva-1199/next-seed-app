This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can use this as a starter project to build any Next.js app.
To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.


    ```
    git clone https://github.com/apoorva-1199/next-seed-app.git
    ```
 
2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor, install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. To make your production ready build, run the following command:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` or adding your own components. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
